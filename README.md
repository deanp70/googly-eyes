# Googly Eyes
A simple ElectronJS app that adds a pair of eyes in the bottom right of your screen, which follow your mouse around.

To run the app, simply clone the repo and `cd` into the folder, then:
```bash
npm ci
npm run start
```

⭐️ Star it if you like it. I built this with ChatGPT's help over a fun hour since I saw it someplace in a video and wanted one for myself.
