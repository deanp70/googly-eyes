# Googly Eyes 👀
A simple ElectronJS app that adds a pair of eyes in the bottom right of your screen, which follow your mouse around.

To run the app, simply clone the repo and `cd` into the folder, then:
```bash
npm ci
npm run start
```

⭐️ Star it if you like it. I built this with ChatGPT's help over a fun hour since I saw it someplace in a video and wanted one for myself.

## Packaging For Mac
If you want to create a proper mac application, so you don't need to run any commands to have the app running simply run the following commands once to create the app:
```bash
npm ci
npm run package-mac
```
You'll see a `dist` folder appear with the app. Double-click it to run it.
